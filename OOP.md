# Object Oriented Programming

The concept that in programming objects being manipulated are more important than the logic needed to manipulate those objects.

* `class` - a logical grouping of data and functions.

* `constructors` are special methods used to create objects while `desctructors` are used to destroy them.

* `methods` - functions which are actions that belong to an object.

* `getter method` - a special method which gets the value of a property.

* `setter method` - a special method which sets the value of a property.

* `initializing` - setting propeties to their initial values when a class is instantiated.

* `instantitation` - the process of creating an instance of a class.

* `parent class` - the "main" class where other classes inherit properties and methods from.

* `properties` - attributes(variables) which describe an object.

* `subclass` - classes which inherit properties and methods from a parent class; it can also define it's own properties and methods.

* `Abstraction` - Hiding all but relevant data about an object in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.

* `Encapsulation` - Mechanism of restricting access to some of the components of an object.

* `Inheritance` - The process of creating a new class based a parent class.

* `Polymorphism` - The process of using an operator/ function in different ways for different data inputs.

* `subclassing` and `inheritance` can help save time by re-using and better organizing code.

## 	OOP Phrase Drills

`classX(Y)` - Make a class named X that is-a Y.

`classX(object):def __init__(self,j)` - class X has-a __init__ that takes self and J parameters

`classX(object):def M(self,J)` - class X has-a function M that takes self and J parameters

`foo = X()` - set foo to an instance of X

`foo.M(J)` - From foo get the M function and call it with parameters self.J

`foo.K = Q` - From foo get the K attribute and set it to Q
